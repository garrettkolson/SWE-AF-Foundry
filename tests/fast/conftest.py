"""Shared fixtures for swe_af.fast tests.

Problem: importing ``swe_af.fast.app`` calls ``app.include_router(fast_router)``,
which replaces each reasoner's ``func`` with a tracking wrapper named
``"tracked_func"``.  Tests that inspect ``fast_router.reasoners`` directly
(test_init_router.py, test_executor.py) then fail because the expected function
names are no longer visible.

Fix: a function-scoped autouse fixture that reloads ``swe_af.fast`` and its
reasoner sub-modules before every test, producing a fresh ``fast_router`` whose
reasoners still carry their original names.  The ``swe_af.fast.app`` module is
*not* reloaded (it stays in sys.modules) because reloading it would call
``include_router`` again and immediately re-mangle the fresh router.
